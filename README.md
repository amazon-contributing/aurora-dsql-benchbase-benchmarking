## Quickstart

### Step 1: Setting up Benchbase

1. This is a forked version of the original Benchbase repository that can be pulled from the amazon-contributing github repo using the following command:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/amazon-contributing/aurora-dsql-benchbase-benchmarking.git
cd aurora-dsql-benchbase-benchmarking
./mvnw clean package -P auroradsql
```

2. After cloning and building the package:

```bash
cd target
tar xvzf benchbase-auroradsql.tgz
cd benchbase-auroradsql
```



### Step 2: Loading TPC-C data

Benchbase offers multiple benchmarks, including TPC-C, that can be run against different databases. We have a sample config and ddl files added to the repository that will allow you to run TPC-C benchmarks against an Aurora DSQL cluster.

1. Edit the `config/auroradsql/sample_tpcc_config.xml file`:

This file contains various settings that can be changed based on how users want to run the benchmarking test. Before loading any data into the table, replace *localhost* in the `<url></url>` tag with your Aurora DSQL cluster endpoint.

Next, set the username and the password inside the `<username></username>` and `<password></password>` tags. If you donâ€™t know how to generate a password token, follow this guide [LINK to token generation].

We have also added automatic password/token generation using IAM authentication in our custom Benchbase implementation. To use it, simply leave the `<password></password>` field empty. To understand where the credentials and region information are fetched from, checkout these libraries:
- [DefaultCredentialsProvider](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/auth/credentials/DefaultCredentialsProvider.html)
- [DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/regions/providers/DefaultAwsRegionProviderChain.html)

Finally, set the `<scalefactor></scalefactor>` to the number of TPC-C warehouses you would like to create and run the benchmarking on.

2. Save the config file and run the following command to create tables and load data:
```shell
java -jar benchbase.jar -b tpcc -c config/auroradsql/sample_tpcc_config.xml --create=true --load=true --execute=false
```

We separated the loading and test execution into two steps. You can set the `--execute` flag to true and have the benchmarking run right after the loading is completed.


Step 3: Running TPC-C and Interpreting Results

1. Run the benchmark using the following command:

```shell
java -jar benchbase.jar -b tpcc -c config/auroradsql/sample_tpcc_config.xml --create=false --load=false --execute=true
```

Once the workload has finished running, Benchbase will output the results in the terminal, a bunch of .csv files in the results folder and a summary.json file in the same folder. The json file (for a 1 warehouse run) will look something like this:
```json
{
 "Start timestamp (milliseconds)": 1731548786702,
 "Current Timestamp (milliseconds)": 1731548847872,
 "Elapsed Time (nanoseconds)": 60000083167,
 "DBMS Type": "AURORADSQL",
 "DBMS Version": null,
 "Benchmark Type": "tpcc",
 "Final State": "EXIT",
 "Measured Requests": 201,
 "isolation": null,
 "scalefactor": "1",
 "terminals": "4",
 "Latency Distribution": {
  "95th Percentile Latency (microseconds)": 2176054,
  "Maximum Latency (microseconds)": 8337726,
  "Median Latency (microseconds)": 1066925,
  "Minimum Latency (microseconds)": 218524,
  "25th Percentile Latency (microseconds)": 456543,
  "90th Percentile Latency (microseconds)": 2085734,
  "99th Percentile Latency (microseconds)": 3827992,
  "75th Percentile Latency (microseconds)": 1747994,
  "Average Latency (microseconds)": 1185045
 },
 "Throughput (requests/second)": 3.349995356515603,
 "Goodput (requests/second)": 3.2999954258213404
}
```

This result indicates that the test ran for `60` seconds and processed `201` transactions. `201` was our `tpmC`, the number of new orders processed in a minute. If we were to run the test for longer than 60 seconds, you would calculate the tpmC by multiplying the `Throughput * 60`.

Checkout the TPC-C documentation to understand how the Tpmc is calculated: https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-c_v5.11.0.pdf

### Step 4: Clean Up

When you are done testing your DSQL cluster.

1. Run the following commands to clean up the package:
```shell
cd ../..
./mvnw clean
```

2. Drop the tables created by the TPC-C workload or delete your cluster by following this guide [LINK on how to delete your DSQL cluster]

## Description

Benchmarking is incredibly useful, yet endlessly painful. This benchmark suite is the result of a group of
PhDs/post-docs/professors getting together and combining their workloads/frameworks/experiences/efforts. We hope this
will save other people's time, and will provide an extensible platform, that can be grown in an open-source fashion.

BenchBase is a multi-threaded load generator. The framework is designed to be able to produce variable rate,
variable mixture load against any JDBC-enabled relational database. The framework also provides data collection
features, e.g., per-transaction-type latency and throughput logs.

The BenchBase framework has the following benchmarks:

* [AuctionMark](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/AuctionMark)
* [CH-benCHmark](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/CH-benCHmark)
* [Epinions.com](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/epinions)
* hyadapt -- pending configuration files
* [NoOp](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/NoOp)
* [OT-Metrics](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/OT-Metrics)
* [Resource Stresser](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/Resource-Stresser)
* [SEATS](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/Seats)
* [SIBench](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/SIBench)
* [SmallBank](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/SmallBank)
* [TATP](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/TATP)
* [TPC-C](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/TPC-C)
* [TPC-H](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/TPC-H)
* TPC-DS -- pending configuration files
* [Twitter](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/Twitter)
* [Voter](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/Voter)
* [Wikipedia](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/Wikipedia)
* [YCSB](https://github.com/cmu-db/benchbase/wiki/YCSB)

This framework is design to allow for easy extension. We provide stub code that a contributor can use to include a new
benchmark, leveraging all the system features (logging, controlled speed, controlled mixture, etc.)

## Usage Guide

### How to Build
Run the following command to build the distribution for a given database specified as the profile name (`-P`).  The following profiles are currently supported: `postgres`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `sqlite`, `cockroachdb`, `phoenix`, `spanner`, and `auroradsql`.

```bash
./mvnw clean package -P <profile name>
```

The following files will be placed in the `./target` folder:

* `benchbase-<profile name>.tgz`
* `benchbase-<profile name>.zip`

### How to Run
Once you build and unpack the distribution, you can run `benchbase` just like any other executable jar.  The following examples assume you are running from the root of the expanded `.zip` or `.tgz` distribution.  If you attempt to run `benchbase` outside of the distribution structure you may encounter a variety of errors including `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`.

To bring up help contents:
```bash
java -jar benchbase.jar -h
```

To execute the `tpcc` benchmark:
```bash
java -jar benchbase.jar -b tpcc -c config/postgres/sample_tpcc_config.xml --create=true --load=true --execute=true
```

For composite benchmarks like `chbenchmark`, which require multiple schemas to be created and loaded, you can provide a comma separated list:
```bash
java -jar benchbase.jar -b tpcc,chbenchmark -c config/postgres/sample_chbenchmark_config.xml --create=true --load=true --execute=true
```

The following options are provided:

```text
usage: benchbase
 -b,--bench <arg>               [required] Benchmark class. Currently
                                supported: [tpcc, tpch, tatp, wikipedia,

                                sibench, noop, smallbank, hyadapt,
                                otmetrics, templated]

 -im,--interval-monitor <arg>   Throughput Monitoring Interval in
                                milliseconds
 -jh,--json-histograms <arg>    Export histograms to JSON file
    --load <arg>                Load data using the benchmark's data
                                loader
 -s,--sample <arg>              Sampling window
```

### How to Run with Maven

Instead of first building, packaging and extracting before running benchbase, it is possible to execute benchmarks directly against the source code using Maven. Once you have the project cloned you can run any benchmark from the root project directory using the Maven `exec:java` goal. For example, the following command executes the `tpcc` benchmark against `postgres`:

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -P postgres -Dexec.args="-b tpcc -c config/postgres/sample_tpcc_config.xml --create=true --load=true --execute=true"
```

this is equivalent to the steps above but eliminates the need to first package and then extract the distribution.

### How to Enable Logging

To enable logging, e.g., for the PostgreSQL JDBC driver, add the following JVM property when starting...

```
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=src/main/resources/logging.properties
```

To modify the logging level you can update [`logging.properties`](src/main/resources/logging.properties) and/or [`log4j.properties`](src/main/resources/log4j.properties).

### How to Release

```
./mvnw -B release:prepare
./mvnw -B release:perform
```

### How use with Docker

- Build or pull a dev image to help building from source:

  ```sh
  ./docker/benchbase/build-dev-image.sh
  ./docker/benchbase/run-dev-image.sh
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  docker run -it --rm --pull \
    -v /path/to/benchbase-source:/benchbase \
    -v $HOME/.m2:/home/containeruser/.m2 \
    benchbase.azure.cr.io/benchbase-dev
  ```

- Build the full image:

  ```sh
  # build an image with all profiles
  ./docker/benchbase/build-full-image.sh

  # or if you only want to build some of them
  BENCHBASE_PROFILES='postgres mysql' ./docker/benchbase/build-full-image.sh
  ```

- Run the image for a given profile:

  ```sh
  BENCHBASE_PROFILE='postgres' ./docker/benchbase/run-full-image.sh --help # or other benchbase args as before
  ```

  or

  ```sh
  docker run -it --rm --env BENCHBASE_PROFILE='postgres' \
    -v results:/benchbase/results benchbase.azurecr.io/benchbase --help # or other benchbase args as before
  ```

> See the [docker/benchbase/README.md](./docker/benchbase/) for further details.

[Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [VSCode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) support is also available.

## Credits

BenchBase is the official modernized version of the original OLTPBench.

The original OLTPBench code was largely written by the authors of the original paper, [OLTP-Bench: An Extensible Testbed for Benchmarking Relational Databases](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p277-difallah.pdf), D. E. Difallah, A. Pavlo, C. Curino, and P. CudrÃ©-Mauroux. In VLDB 2014. Please see the citation guide below.

A significant portion of the modernization was contributed by [Tim Veil @ Cockroach Labs](https://github.com/timveil-cockroach), including but not limited to:

* Built with and for Java ~~17~~ 21.
* Migration from Ant to Maven.
  * Reorganized project to fit Maven structure.
  * Removed static `lib` directory and dependencies.
  * Updated required dependencies and removed unused or unwanted dependencies.
  * Moved all non `.java` files to standard Maven `resources` directory.
  * Shipped with [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper).
* Improved packaging and versioning.
    * Moved to Calendar Versioning (https://calver.org/).
    * Project is now distributed as a `.tgz` or `.zip` with an executable `.jar`.
    * All code updated to read `resources` from inside `.jar` instead of directory.
* Moved from direct dependence on Log4J to SLF4J.
* Reorganized and renamed many files for clarity and consistency.
* Applied countless fixes based on "Static Analysis".
    * JDK migrations (boxing, un-boxing, etc.).
    * Implemented `try-with-resources` for all `java.lang.AutoCloseable` instances.
    * Removed calls to `printStackTrace()` or `System.out.println` in favor of proper logging.
* Reformatted code and cleaned up imports.
* Removed all calls to `assert`.
* Removed various forms of dead code and stale configurations.
* Removed calls to `commit()` during `Loader` operations.
* Refactored `Worker` and `Loader` usage of `Connection` objects and cleaned up transaction handling.
* Introduced [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) to keep Maven dependencies up to date.
* Simplified output flags by removing most of them, generally leaving the reporting functionality enabled by default.
* Provided an alternate `Catalog` that can be populated directly from the configured Benchmark database. The old catalog was proxied through `HSQLDB` -- this remains an option for DBMSes that may have incomplete catalog support.
